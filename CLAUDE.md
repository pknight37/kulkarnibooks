# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

Kulkarni Books is a simple static website. There is no build step, framework, or package manager — just plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript served directly from the repo root.

## Development

Open `index.html` directly in a browser, or use any static file server. For example:

```bash
# Python (no install needed)
python3 -m http.server 8080

# Node (if npx is available)
npx serve .
```

## Conventions

- All pages are plain `.html` files in the repo root or subdirectories.
- CSS lives in a `styles/` directory; JavaScript in a `scripts/` directory (create these as needed).
- No minification, bundling, or compilation is expected.

## Test-Driven Development (Canon TDD)

All code in this repo follows Kent Beck's Canon TDD workflow. Source: https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/canon-tdd

### The Five Steps

1. **Write a test list** — Before touching code, list all expected behavioral variants for the change: cases where the new behavior should work, plus potential impacts on existing behavior.
2. **Write one test** — Convert exactly one item from the list into a concrete, automated test (setup, invocation, assertions). Make interface design decisions here; minimize implementation decisions.
3. **Make it pass** — Change the code so the new test and all previous tests pass. Fix the code genuinely — do not delete assertions or hard-code expected values.
4. **Refactor (optional)** — Now make implementation design decisions. Never mix refactoring with making a test pass; keep these phases separate.
5. **Repeat** — Return to step 2 until the test list is empty.

### Key Rules

- Write tests one at a time; do not speculatively write all tests upfront. Order matters and shapes the final design.
- Never refactor while a test is failing.
- Duplication in code is a hint, not an automatic trigger — don't abstract prematurely.

## UI/UX Design Principles

All UI work in this repo follows these principles. Optimize for intuitive use over clever design.

### Core Philosophy

- Clarity over cleverness, speed over ornamentation, consistency over novelty, usability over density.
- Primary objective: help users accomplish their goal with minimal cognitive load.

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout

- One clear primary action per screen/view; secondary actions visually de-emphasized.
- Use size, color, and spacing to indicate importance. Group related items.
- 8px base spacing system. Spacing scale: 4 / 8 / 12 / 16 / 24 / 32 / 48 / 64.
- Line length ~60–80 characters for readability.
- Use whitespace generously; chunk information.

### Typography

- Limit to 1–2 font families. Avoid excessive font weights.
- Clear heading hierarchy: H1 (page title) → H2 (section) → H3 (subsection) → body → caption.

### Color

- 1 primary color, 1–2 accent colors, neutral grayscale for most UI.
- Semantic colors: green = success, yellow = warning, red = error, blue = primary action.
- Meet WCAG AA contrast minimums.

### Components & Interactions

- Navigation: persistent location awareness, clear current state.
- Buttons: 1 primary per view, destructive actions require confirmation.
- Forms: labels always visible (not just placeholders), inline validation, sensible defaults.
- Modals: use sparingly, must be dismissible, never block critical workflows.

### States & Feedback

- Every action produces visible feedback.
- Design for all states: loading, empty, success, error.
- Empty states should explain what to do next and include a primary action.

### Accessibility

- Sufficient color contrast (WCAG AA).
- Keyboard navigable.
- Clear labels on all inputs.
- Touch targets ≥ 44px.

### Cognitive UX Laws

- **Hick's Law**: reduce choices presented at once.
- **Fitts's Law**: make primary actions large and easy to click/tap.
- **Jakob's Law**: follow common UI patterns users already know.
- **Von Restorff Effect**: important elements should visually stand out.

### Design Quality Checklist

Before finalizing any UI, verify:
- Is the primary user goal obvious?
- Is the primary action obvious?
- Is anything unnecessary on the screen?
- Can a first-time user succeed without instructions?
- Are errors prevented where possible?
- Is the interface accessible?
